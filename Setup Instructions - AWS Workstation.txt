AWS Server Setup
The assumption is that you have gone through the basic start of an AWS instance

1) Download and install mysql server
		sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6
		
		Move the location of the databases to a new location
		
		mysql -uroot -p to confirm that you can login.
		

2) Create Pentaho user account
		sudo useradd -m -d /home/pentaho -s /bin/bash -c "pentaho service account" -U pentaho
		sudo passwd pentaho
		sudo adduser pentaho sudo    'add user to sudoer group
		sudo cp -r /home/ubuntu/.ssh ~/.
		sudo chown -R pentaho:pentaho .ssh
		login as the pentaho user
		su pentaho
		whoami   'to test that you are now logged in as pentaho
		
3) The scripts use MySql local-path configurations to connect to MySQL
		info here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-config-editor.html
		MySQL has a utility that will allow you to build the required connections which are stored
		MySQL has a utility that will allow you to build the required connections which are stored
		for any user that is calling the scripts. To run it simply enter the following at command line:
			mysql_config_editor set --login-path=local --host=localhost --user=root --password

		You can look at the local config file settings by running the following.
			mysql_config_editor print --all

		NOTE: For bulk load we are using the root user, since all access is local. 
		You may want to change to use a different user. If you do you will need to modify the database config files
		and the mysql-config-editor settings
