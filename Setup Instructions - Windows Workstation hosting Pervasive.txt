Some of these instructions are not strictly required, but I am doing them since I am
using this machine as both a Pervasive server, and as the way that I open TeamViewer
to get remote access.

If you plan on having a version of Pentaho running here (not strictly required)
1) Get Oracle JDK and install
2) Note: Oracle JDK will change the path to have the latest java version as the first item on the path that will play havoc with Pervasive.SQL Control Center, so you need to change Java to be after Pervasive in the path statements

Setup Instructions - Pentaho Workstation
1) Download Pentaho
2) Unzip to any location
3) Rename DataIntegration folder to the complete version name. e.g. pdi-ce-5.3.0.0-213
4) Gather any jar files needed for DB drivers and place in pdi-ce-##/lib
	- Pervasive: jpscs.jar, pvjdbc2.jar, pvjdbc2x.jar, pvjdbc2.dll
	- MySql: mysql-connector-java-5.1.17.jar
5) Run spoon.bat
6) Establish connectivity by opening and running TestConnection.ktr transaction


GitHub
1) Download GitHub for Windows
2) Install
3) Login to GitHub using your user account on GitHub
4) Clone the ETL repository to a local directory:
	I have used the same Pentaho directory as base e.g. /pentaho/ETL

Miscellaneous Programs
1) Download and Install Notepad++
2) Download and Install Filezilla for FTP


C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;C:\PVSW\bin;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\

MySql Workbench (not required)
1) Download MySql Workbench
2) Make sure you have the Microsoft C++ Redistributable bpack
3) Run MySql Workbench program.
4) Create a connection to the MySql server

Filezilla
1) Just using this to move files over to the Ubuntu workstation/server
