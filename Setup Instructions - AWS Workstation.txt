AWS Server Setup
The assumption is that you have gone through the basic start of an AWS instance

1) Download and install mysql server
		sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6
		
		Move the location of the databases to a new location
		
		mysql -uroot -p to confirm that you can login.
		

2) Create Pentaho user account
		sudo useradd -m -d /home/pentaho -s /bin/bash -c "pentaho service account" -U pentaho
		sudo passwd pentaho
		sudo adduser pentaho sudo    'add user to sudoer group
		sudo cp -r /home/root/.ssh ~/.
		sudo chown pentaho:pentaho .ssh
		login as the pentaho user
		su pentaho
		whoami   'to test that you are now logged in as pentaho
		
3) The scripts use MySql local-path configurations to connect to MySQL
		info here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-config-editor.html
		MySQL has a utility that will allow you to build the required connections which are stored
		for any user that is calling the scripts.
		To simplify things, simply run the $ETL_HOME/scripts/create_config.sh and provide the appropriate
		password.
		NOTE: For bulk load we are using the root user, since all access is local. 
		You may want to change to use a different user. If you do you will need to modify the database config files
		and the mysql-config-editor settings
